    "Nobel Prize winning mathematician John Nash considered game theory strategy in terms of optimization. In calculus or differential equations, we often find a saddle point exists. When we find such a saddle point in game theory, neither player can improve their payoff by switching strategies. In such a case, we call the resulting equilibrium pair or mixed strategy solution the **Nash Equilibrium**.\n",
