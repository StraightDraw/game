    "- **Game Theory and Strategy**, by Philip D. Straffin\n",
    "   - [Linked on BookFinder](https://www.bookfinder.com/search/?isbn=9780883856376)\n",
    "- **The Compleat Strategist**, by J. D. Williams\n",

    "\n",
    "These textbooks can be found used online and, at times, for less than $\\$15$. The Straffin book is one of the best 3 mathematics textbooks I have ever read, and it would be a great supplement to the class if it can be found at a reasonable price (say, $\\$25$ or less). The book by Williams is an inconic and early work which would be less useful for this course than Straffin. Yet, it is a classic, and a mathematics major with a serious interest in Game Theory will appreciate aquiring it inexpensively."
