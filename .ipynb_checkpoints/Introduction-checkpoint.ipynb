The Straffin book is one of the best 3 mathematics textbooks I have ever read, and it would be a great supplement to the class if it can be found at a reasonable price (say, $\\$25$ or less). The book by Williams is an inconic and early work which would be less useful for this course than Straffin. Yet, it is a classic, and a mathematics major with a serious interest in Game Theory will appreciate aquiring inexpensively."
